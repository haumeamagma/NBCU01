# HO010 - Event-Driven Hyperautomation using SAP Integration Suite and SAP Build

## Description

Learn how to build an event-driven hyperautomation scenario where you react and respond to a new hire business event from SAP SuccessFactors using SAP Integration Suite. From SAP Integration Suite we would leverage Advanced Event Mesh and Cloud Integration capabilities.
This also includes human interactions to achieve an end-to-end employee onboarding business process using SAP Build Process Automation.


## Overview
  
This session introduces attendees to <b>Hyperautomation</b>. Gartner identified hyperautomation as the Top 10 Strategic Technology Trends for 2022 and it defines hyperautomation as:
<br/><br/>
<i>“Hyperautomation is a business-driven, disciplined approach that organizations use to rapidly identify, vet and automate as many business and IT processes as possible. Hyperautomation involves the orchestrated use of multiple technologies, tools or platforms, including: artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, event-driven software architecture, robotic process automation (RPA), business process management (BPM) and intelligent business process management suites (iBPMS), integration platform as a service (iPaaS), low-code/no-code tools, packaged software, and other types of decision, process and task automation tools.”</i>


<b>SAP Integration Suite</b> & <b>SAP Build Process Automation</b> can support our customers today by quickly identifying, vetting and automating as many processes as possible.
