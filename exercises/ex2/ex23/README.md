## Summary

At the end of this exercise, you should have a running integration flow that triggers the equipment and training approval workflow as and when a new employee gets added to SAP SuccessFactors.

Next, we will test the integration scenario. Instructors would add a new employee in SAP SuccessFactors, triggering an event which will be pushed to your newly created integration flows in real-time.
