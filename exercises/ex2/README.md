## Exercise 2 - Copy, configure and deploy the Equipment and Training Approval subscription flow

In the second part of the exercise, you will setup an integration flow that listens to the Advanced Event Mesh queue that is subscribed to the topic `SuccessFactors/NewHire` exposed by SAP SuccessFactors. This triggers a workflow where the manager can decide the equipment and training required for the newly hired employee created in SAP SuccessFactors. To achieve this, we will be using SAP Build Process Automation, the AI-powered, intuitive, and no-code solution for workflow management and RPA availble on the SAP Business Technology Platform.
